## Problem Statement

The successful completion of the individual project was an essential part of the Human-Computer Interaction Design master’s degree. It
enabled me to demonstrate that I have the knowledge, skills and organisational capabilities required to carry out a small-scale piece of work that addresses a clearly specified
problem using appropriate and rigorous methods.

## Process and Outcome

The study investigated persuasive technologies and its impact on the user’s behaviour in
the context of mobile commerce. In the study, an evaluation of the persuasive technologies
in Amazon’s mobile app was conducted using the persuasive system design model, a highly
regard framework for evaluating persuasive systems. In addition, an experimental study
was carried out which involved the design of two m-commerce app prototypes with one
prototype applying Fogg’s eight-step design process, regarded as the best practice in early
stage design of persuasive technologies. In order to measure each prototype apps impact
on behaviour, the dimension of system influence on behaviour change from the persuasive
potential questionnaire was used in the experiment. The questionnaire was completed by
the participants after using each prototype app. From the results of the research, it is clear
that persuasive technologies in m-commerce has have an impact on the user’s behaviour.
