## Problem Statement

The purpose of the module assignment was to assess my development skills in ASP.NET, C# and MS SQL 2014 technologies. In addition, the web app used Bootstrap Technologies.

The web app developed was a pre-loved selling web app called Elmtree, similar to Gumtree. it was a localised platform for university students to buy and sell various items.
