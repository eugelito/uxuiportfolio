## Problem Statement

The purpose of the module assignment was to assess my development skills in ASP.NET, C# and MS SQL 2014 technologies. In addition, the web app used Bootstrap Technologies.

The web app developed was a pre-loved selling web app called Elmtree, similar to Gumtree. It was a localized platform for university students to buy and sell various items.

## Process and Outcome

Developed an ASP.NET C# web application integrated with an MS SQL database. The application enabled users to register as sellers, securely log in, and manage item listings through a user-friendly interface styled with Bootstrap. Implemented full CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete) for item listings.
