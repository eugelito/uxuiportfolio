## Problem Statement

The project focused on capturing information architecture (IA) requirements, designing, and evaluating solutions with potential users for an information-rich, web-based domain of our choice.

Objectives:

- Capture IA Requirements: Identify and document the information architecture requirements within an information-rich domain of your choice.
- Design IA for a Web-Based Environment: Develop the IA for a web-based information environment (e.g., website, online store, intranet, or web-based app) in your chosen domain. The design should:
  - Effectively organise and label information.
  - Support seamless navigation and help users locate the information they need.
- Evaluate IA Design: Assess the design from an IA perspective by conducting evaluations with potential users, ensuring it meets their needs and usability expectations.

## Process and Outcome

The chosen domain was Health and Fitness. Balsamiq Mockups was used as the design tool to create the information architecture. The deliverables included:

<strong>Sitemap</strong>: A hierarchical structure of the website's content.

<strong>User Journey</strong>: A detailed outline of user interactions and navigation paths.

<strong>Wireframes</strong>: Visual representations of key pages to illustrate layout and functionality.

This approach ensured a user-centred design tailored to the needs of the domain.
