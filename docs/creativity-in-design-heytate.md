## Problem Statement

Challenge Statement: How can we enhance connected services through the Internet of Things (IoT) in museum and gallery spaces?

## Process and Outcome

The chosen gallery was Tate Modern in London. After selecting the space and conducting user research through observations and onsite interviews with visitors, the challenge statement was defined as:

"Using the Internet of Things (IoT), how can we enhance the gallery experience for ‘non-art lovers’ at the Tate Modern?"

To address this challenge, a variety of creativity techniques and tools were utilised throughout the design process, including:

- Creative Problem Solving
- Brainstorming
- Double Diamond Model
- ALUo (Advantages, Limitations, Unique Opportunities)
- Voting
- Imagery Trek
- Moodboard
- Wishful Thinking
- BrightSparks
- Storyboard

These methods fostered innovative solutions and ensured the design process was engaging and user-focused.
