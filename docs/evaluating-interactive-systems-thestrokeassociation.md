## Problem Statement

This individual coursework assignment involved planning, conducting, and reporting a comprehensive evaluation of **The Stroke Association** website.

The Stroke Association is a leading UK charity dedicated to supporting stroke survivors, their families, and caregivers. Its website ([https://www.stroke.org.uk/](https://www.stroke.org.uk/)) offers a wealth of information on stroke prevention, support services, research initiatives, and fundraising opportunities. The website serves a broad audience, including stroke survivors, their families, healthcare professionals, volunteers, and the general public.

For this project, I took on the role of a usability consultant, tasked by The Stroke Association to complete two primary activities:

1. **Competitor Review**  
   I conducted a competitor review, establishing 10 key review criteria and identifying three similar websites for comparison. This helped identify areas where The Stroke Association’s website could be improved, drawing insights from competitor best practices.

2. **User Testing**  
   I planned and executed a series of user tests to address two primary concerns:

   - **Homepage Evaluation**: The Stroke Association wanted to understand users' impressions of the homepage, including the clarity of its message, the visibility of its purpose, and the overall user experience (UX).
   - **Usability of Fundraising and Shopping Sections**: There were specific concerns regarding the usability of the fundraising events and online shopping sections of the site. The aim was to identify potential friction points and ensure these areas were intuitive and easy to navigate.

## Process and Outcome

The project combined user-centred design principles with rigorous usability testing to gather actionable insights, ultimately contributing to a more user-friendly and effective website.
