## Problem Statement

A final year group project assessment of designing and developing a mobile application on Android Studio using Java technology.

## Process and Outcome

I led and managed a team in a successful final year undergraduate project of developing ‘Runnable’, a running android application. The group project increased and enhanced my knowledge, understanding and skills in mobile and web app development.

Developed using Android Studio with Java, PHP, XML, and MySQL.
Included wireframes for the app design and functionality.

Mobile App Features:

- Track Statistics: Track various statistics for walking, jogging, and running activities.
- Play Music: Use the phone’s built-in music player during activities.
- Camera Integration: Launch the camera to capture images during your run, upload them to the app, and view other users’ uploaded images.
- Route Calculation: Calculate and display a route for your activity.
- Location Tracking: View your current location on a map.
